		about_description: "Bartiméus is a foundation which has a lot of knowledge and experience in supporting people with visual and/or additional disabilities. If they haven’t got the knowledge (yet), they will develop it in a form of new methods and trainings. That way they contribute on a better life for people with a visual or additional disability. They also see it their mission to make the society more alert and accessible so people with visual disability can live their life as much as they can. They make their knowledge and experience available and are actively taking a part in the public debate.",
